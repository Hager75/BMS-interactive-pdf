    <p class="list-header">Severe and Fatal Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions</p>

  <p class="mb-2">Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue. While immune-mediated adverse reactions usually manifest during treatment, they can also occur after discontinuation of OPDIVO QVANTIG. Early identification and management are essential to ensure safe use of OPDIVO QVANTIG. Monitor for signs and
symptoms that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune- mediated adverse reactions. Evaluate clinical chemistries including liver enzymes, creatinine, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, including
infection. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as appropriate.
Withhold or permanently discontinue OPDIVO QVANTIG depending on severity (please see Section 2 Dosage and Administration in the accompanying Full Prescribing Information). In general, if OPDIVO QVANTIG interruption or discontinuation is required, administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to
Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over for at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose immune-mediated adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid therapy.
Toxicity management guidelines for adverse reactions that do not necessarily require systemic steroids (e.g., endocrinopathies and dermatologic reactions) are discussed below</p>
</li>
  <li>
    <p class="list-header">Immune-Mediated Pneumonitis
</p>
  <p class="mb-2">OPDIVO QVANTIG can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis. The incidence of pneumonitis is higher in patients who have received prior thoracic radiation.
Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 2.8% (7/247) of patients receiving OPDIVO QVANTIG, including Grade 3 (0.8%) and Grade 2 (2.0%) adverse reactions.</p>
</li>
  <li>
    <p class="list-header">Immune-Mediated Colitis 
</p>
  <p class="mb-2">OPDIVO QVANTIG can cause immune-mediated colitis. A common symptom included in the definition of colitis was diarrhea. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection/reactivation has been reported in patients with corticosteroid- refractory immune-mediated colitis. In cases of corticosteroid-refractory colitis, consider repeating infectious workup to exclude alternative
etiologies.
Immune-mediated colitis occurred in 2.8% (7/247) of patients receiving OPDIVO QVANTIG, including Grade 3 (0.4%) and Grade 2 (2.4%) adverse reactions</p>
</li>

  <li>
    <p class="list-header">Immune-Mediated Hepatitis and Hepatotoxicity 
</p>
  <p class="mb-2">OPDIVO QVANTIG can cause immune-mediated hepatitis.
Immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 2.4% (6/247) of patients receiving OPDIVO QVANTIG, including Grade 3 (1.6%), and Grade 2 (0.8%) adverse reactions. Intravenous nivolumab in combination with cabozantinib can cause hepatic toxicity with higher frequencies of Grade 3 and 4 ALT and AST elevations compared to intravenous nivolumab alone. Consider more
frequent monitoring of liver enzymes as compared to when the drugs are administered as single agents. With the combination of intravenous nivolumab and cabozantinib, Grades 3 and 4 increased ALT or AST were seen in 11% (35/320) of patients.</p>
</li>
  <li>
    <p class="list-header">Immune-Mediated Endocrinopathies
</p>
  <p class="mb-2">OPDIVO QVANTIG can cause primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency, immune-mediated hypophysitis, immune-mediated thyroid disorders, and Type 1 diabetes mellitus, which can present with diabetic ketoacidosis. Withhold OPDIVO QVANTIG depending on severity (please see section 2 Dosage and Administration in the accompanying Full Prescribing
Information). For Grade 2 or higher adrenal insufficiency, initiate symptomatic treatment, including hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Hypophysitis can present with acute symptoms associated with mass effect such as headache, photophobia, or visual field defects. Hypophysitis can cause hypopituitarism; initiate hormone replacement as clinically
indicated. Thyroiditis can present with or without endocrinopathy. Hypothyroidism can follow hyperthyroidism; initiate hormone replacement or medical management as clinically indicated. Monitor patients for hyperglycemia or other signs and symptoms of diabetes; initiate treatment with insulin as clinically indicated.</p>
</li>

  <li>
    <p class="list-header">Immune-Mediated Endocrinopathies (continued)

</p>
  <p class="mb-2">Adrenal insufficiency occurred in 2% (5/247) of patients receiving OPDIVO QVANTIG, including Grade 3 (0.8%) and Grade 2 (1.2%) adverse reactions. Adrenal insufficiency occurred in 4.7% (15/320) of patients with RCC who received intravenous nivolumab with cabozantinib, including Grade 3 (2.2%) and Grade 2 (1.9%) adverse reactions. Hypophysitis occurred in
0.6% (12/1994) of patients treated with single agent intravenous nivolumab, including Grade 3 (0.2%) and Grade 2 (0.3%). Thyroiditis occurred in 0.4% (1/247) of patients receiving OPDIVO QVANTIG, including a Grade 1 (0.4%) adverse reaction.

  <li>
    <p class="list-header">Immune-Mediated Nephritis with Renal Dysfunction
</p>
  <p class="mb-2">OPDIVO QVANTIG can cause immune-mediated nephritis.
Grade 2 immune-mediated nephritis and renal dysfunction occurred in 1.2% (3/247) of patients receiving OPDIVO QVANTIG.</p>
</li>
  <li>
    <p class="list-header">Immune-Mediated Dermatologic Adverse Reactions
</p>
  <p class="mb-2">OPDIVO QVANTIG can cause immune-mediated rash or dermatitis. Exfoliative dermatitis, including Stevens- Johnson Syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), and DRESS (drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms), has occurred with PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies. Topical emollients and/or topical corticosteroids may be adequate to treat mild to
moderate non-exfoliative rashes. Withhold or permanently discontinue OPDIVO QVANTIG depending on severity (please see section 2 Dosage and Administration in the accompanying Full Prescribing Information).
Immune-mediated rash occurred in 7% (17/247) of patients, including Grade 3 (0.8%) and Grade 2 (2.8%) adverse reactions.</p>
</li>
  <li>
    <p class="list-header">Other Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions
</p>
  <p class="mb-2">The following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred at an incidence of &lt;1% (unless otherwise noted) in patients who received OPDIVO QVANTIG or intravenous nivolumab as single agent or in combination with chemotherapy or immunotherapy, or were reported with the use of other PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies. Severe or fatal cases 
have been reported for some of these adverse reactions: cardiac/vascular: myocarditis, pericarditis, vasculitis; nervous system: meningitis, encephalitis, myelitis and demyelination, myasthenic syndrome/myasthenia gravis (including exacerbation)uillain-Barré yndrome, nerve paresis, autoimmune neuropathy; ocular: uveitis, iritis, and other ocular inflammatory
toxicities can occur; gastrointestinal: pancreatitis to include increases in serum amylase and lipase levels, gastritis, duodenitis; musculoskeletal and connective tissue: myositis/polymyositis,habdomyolysis, and associated sequelae including renal failure, arthritis, polymyalgia rheumatica; endocrine: hypoparathyroidism; other (hematologic/immune): hemolytic
anemia, aplastic anemia, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), systemic inflammatory response syndrome, histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis (Kikuchi lymphadenitis), sarcoidosis, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, solid organ transplant rejection, other transplant (including corneal graft) rejection.
Some ocular IMAR cases can be associated with retinal detachment. Various grades of visual impairment, including blindness, can occur. If uveitis occurs in combination with other immune-mediated adverse reactions, consider a Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada-like syndrome, as this may require treatment with systemic corticosteroids to reduce the risk of permanent
vision loss.</p>
</li>
  <li>
    <p class="list-header">Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation
</p>
  <p class="mb-2">Fatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) before or after being treated with OPDIVO QVANTIG. Transplant-related complications include hyperacute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), acute GVHD, chronic GVHD, hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) after reduced intensity
conditioning, and steroid-requiring febrile syndrome (without an identified infectious cause). These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between OPDIVO QVANTIG and allogeneic HSCT.
Follow patients closely for evidence of transplant-related complications and intervene promptly. Consider the benefit versus risks of treatment with OPDIVO QVANTIG prior to or after an allogeneic HSCT.</p>
</li>
  <li>
    <p class="list-header">Increased Mortality in Patients with Multiple Myeloma when Nivolumab Is Added to a Thalidomide Analogue and Dexamethasone
</p>
  <p class="mb-2">In randomized clinical trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of a PD-1 blocking antibody, including intravenous nivolumab, to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone, a use for which no PD-1 or PD-L1 blocking antibody is indicated, resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of patients with multiple myeloma with a PD-1 or PD-L1 blocking antibody in combination with a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone is not recommended outside of controlled clinical trials.</p>
</li>
  <li>
    <p class="list-header">Lactation
</p>
  <p class="mb-2">There are no data on the presence of nivolumab or hyaluronidase in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in the breastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment and for 5 months after the last dose of OPDIVO QVANTIG.
